ai is being used extensively to generate content but, here are some things i don't find ok :

- style (everything sounds the same)
- no novel ideas (everyone writes the same)
- yapping (irrelevant information no one needs)
- non-reliable style cloning (you can't clone styles reliably using few-shot examples)
- fine-tuning is hard (and i am lazy)
- people are lazy, no will to self-curate (everybody wants the ai to do everything - but are afraid of AGI lol)

### what are my thoughts as a consumer ?

i am an ai engineer with above average joe search skills at least. 
as someone who likes to read blogs and twitter threads, (not linkedin BS, please never :)), these are some things that make me engage with the content : 

- exclusivity of information (i can't get it somewhere else). for example :
	- workflows
	- thoughts on something
	- new experiments

- writing style (the way someone writes) for example :
	- mark manson (for strong and witty language)
	- sam altman blog (concise, and direct thoughts)
	- dan koe (dense, hard hitting lines that gives you can itch in the mind)


but, what turns me off instantly when i see content is : 

- overuse of emojis (linkedin is professional, since when you started emojis huhhhh !)
- yapping (ai yaps, but you post that yap - so in my eyes you yapped)
- irritation while reading the text
- no personality (why will i read your post if i can get the same things from gpt, better than you can generate tbh :)) 
- creating content for the "sake" of it (do some work, and then post it. not work for posting)


### now, where does ai comes to the picture ?

all of these things that turns me off while reading, are a direct-effect of using "AI" to **generate** content for the sake of it, and without a second thought or reading.

just tell me, how can you read this without thinking cringe ? just tell me the truth :

really man ? people will post this. logistics ? just stfu.


#### now, there is only one problem .

you have heard this one : "a warrior in a garden is better than a gardener in a war" and people are just the "gardeners in war". they don't want to learn how to properly use AI

content is being **generated** out of FOMO, without even a bit of second thought of differentiation. they don'e even proof-read it.

> ***at least don't outsource your intelligence, take help, don't depend on it !***

i hate to see this pollution happening on the internet. everyone with a twitter/linkedin account makes an account and starts yapping (the ai yaps, and they post, so they yap ok !)

### i get it, but how can i improve and write good content ?

just three things, that you are trained and made to do will improve everything : 

- think
- create
- write

this will make everything better, the internet will still have good enough content. 
people are not willing to write but are willing to post.

listen up, people who know about your laziness, will instantly reject you. atleast i will if i hire sometimes in the future.


### don't generate, "self-curate"

give your own master data and ask chatgpt to edit it minimally and then post something. you will be amazed of the quality you get. this is what it is made for.

look, chatgpt is AI.

AI systems need a goal and context to perform.
you give the goal, but the context ? you don't give it

do this simple practice and you will be able to generate good enough content that takes humanity 0.00000000000001 step forward. this is huge contribution. post to help. not to post.

- do what you are doing, and keep making rough notes at each step
- combine those notes into one file
- mark them by date or time as you were writing
- now, give it to an LLM and ask it to extract insights and my learnings from it
- there are many ways to do this, experiment and find what you need
- now, ask it to write a concise linkedin/x post that people can learn from. no yapping
- now, post it
- ask for review and then thank me later.

### a your post is your own thought, and if even that small thought is generated by an LLM -> idk where you are going


> stop yapping, start wrtiing, start posting.


## conclusion

content creation was always a problem of self. you will do and you will create.
what ai can do, is make the expression of your work and the problems you solved and logged  (linkedin/X) posts presentable to other humans and help them learn from it.
it won't write what you didn't do. one more thing, remember this .
