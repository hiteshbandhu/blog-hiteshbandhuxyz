starting today, i’m embarking on a 30-day hustle to master gen-ai and prove my worth as an llm engineer.  

why? i’ve been searching for a job in ai, but the response has been underwhelming. i thought i had what it takes to build cutting-edge gen-ai apps, but the rejections tell a different story. it’s clear there are gaps in my knowledge.  

i’m not starting from scratch, though—this is a 1 -> 100 journey. over the past 3 months, i’ve learned a lot about myself, my strengths, and the areas where i need to improve. now, i’m putting all of it into action with a focused plan.  

here’s what to expect:  
- daily updates on study topics, progress, and projects i’ll be building.  
- complete transparency to stay accountable and consistent.  
- resources and learnings i’ll document and share.  
- my blogging website (coming soon) to centralize everything.  

this is my 100% shot, no excuses. i’m tired of rejections, tired of stagnation—this is the time to act. let’s go.
