* why did i make this roadmap ? read [this](https://blog.hiteshbandhu.xyz/blog/genai-hustle-announcement) *

*** adding resources to each day as i go, keep checking back for regular updates ***

> this 30-day roadmap is for intermediate developers who want to master llm application development. it covers everything from api setup and llm integration to advanced topics like rag, agent workflows, and testing. focused, practical, and straight to the point, it's designed to get you building production-ready llm apps fast.

---

## week 1: foundation & basic llm integration

### days 1-2: setup & basic api
- fastapi basics
- async programming
- building endpoints for llm interactions
- api key management, error handling, streaming responses  


### days 3-4: llm fundamentals
- understanding tokens, context windows, temperature
- exploring llm models (gpt-4, claude, gemini)
- implementing model switching
- model selection, cost optimization, response handling  




### days 5-7: prompt engineering basics
- system vs user prompts
- few-shot learning, chain of thought
- structured outputs (json, xml)
- building a prompt template system  

---

## week 2: advanced llm patterns

### days 8-10: retrieval-augmented generation (rag)
- vector databases (pinecone, weaviate)
- chunking strategies and embedding models
- hybrid search techniques
- building a rag system with multiple retrieval strategies  


### days 11-12: advanced rag & caching
- semantic caching
- parent-child chunking
- recursive retrieval and multi-query retrieval
- adaptive rag system  


### days 13-14: llm output processing
- json mode and structured outputs
- output parsing and validation
- error recovery strategies
- response filtering  


---

## week 3: testing & agents

### days 15-17: llm testing framework
- unit testing llm applications
- testing prompts and templates
- evaluating llms using metrics (rouge, bleu)
- setting up automated testing pipelines  

            

### days 18-21: ai agents & workflows
- agent frameworks (langchain, autogen)
- agent memory and state management
- multi-agent orchestration
- building a research agent with multiple tools  


---

## week 4: advanced features & capstone

### days 22-24: advanced features
- conversation memory patterns
- custom tool development
- rate limiting and queuing
- cost optimization  



### days 25-27: capstone project
- building an ai-powered research assistant
- implementing rag with multiple knowledge bases
- conversation memory with context persistence
- integrating specialist agents for different tasks  




### days 28-30: polish & deploy
- completing test suite and performance optimization
- adding monitoring and logging
- preparing documentation and deploying to a cloud platform  

---

## best practices to follow
- always test llm outputs  
- monitor token usage and optimize  
- handle errors gracefully with retry logic  
- document prompt templates and use version control
